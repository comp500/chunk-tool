# chunk-tool
A tool using NW.js to interface with ComputerCraft computers with the Chunk client.

It's so simple to start the development version. First install node.js and npm, then:

	git clone https://github.com/comp500/chunk-tool.git
	cd chunk-tool
	npm install
	npm start
	
And to build the application, just run `npm build`.
